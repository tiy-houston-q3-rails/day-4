Create a Concert!!!!
------

A promoter has asked you to create a concert application for them.
You'll have a Ruby application where you can:

1. Display to the user a list of opening-acts that they can choose from
2. Let the user choose 2 of the opening-acts
3. Let the user enter information for a new headline-act
4. Let the user press "Play" and output the acts in order

Due: Monday morning, 9am

For example:


"Grave Band   -> 20 minutes"
"Freaky Friday -> 30 minutes"
"HEADLINER: Dave's Weeekend -> 70 minutes"



Tech Details

band_name = gets
Band.new band_name
